# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis

## Overview

We have been asked to determine the number of retiring employees per title and have been asked to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

As the employees in our organization age out, it will be critical for us to future proof our company and adequately plan for potential gaps in different areas or our organization to maintain our competitive position.

The reports we will walk through will expose the areas of our organization that are most at risk and will hilight employees who may have potential for future leadership positions.

## Results

### Major Take Aways

#### Deliverable 1
- The largest group at risk is our engineering group, if we do not adequately backfill this group, our product quality will suffer.
- The second largest group at risk is our Senior Staff group.

#### Deliverable 2
- The largest groups we have for mentorship are the engineering groups. There are more Engineers than Senior engineers in the Mentorship group so we may have an opportunity to promote many of the regular engineers to Senior engineers.
- We have many team members in the senior staff group that we could promote to managers to backfill the 2 manager positions that may be retiring soon.

## Summary

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "Silver Tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- We have 77,598 employees at risk of retirement, we should expect the first wave to be approximately 20K employees.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- If we limit the mentorship to only employees born in 1965, then we will only have 1,940 employees to mentor enough employees to fill 77,598 at risk positions. This means each mentor would need to take approximately 40 employees under their wing. If each mentorship requires 1 hour per week, then each employee we have that could do a mentorship would effectively have to stop doing their regular jobs and mentor full time. To maintain productivity of our employees who would engage in the mentorship, we may need to extend the mentorship group to include more employees to maintain productivity and ensure the longevity of our business.
